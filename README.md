# Docuware Autostore

Automatically store documents from document tray to file cabinet using DocuWare REST API. Multiple tasks can be configured with different trays, intellix trusts levels, document title masks and processing limits.

This script addresses lack of automation within DocuWare cloud that forces logged in user to manually store each document in their tray, even if the intelligent indexing confidence score is high (green). For scenarios where DocuWare is used to intelligently index large volumes of archived documents or emails any manual intervention can quickly become unmaintainable.

## Install

Install Node Packages

```
npm install
```

Compile the code so it can be run, also required if any typescript files are changed

```
npx tsc
```

Create a new config.json autostore configuration in root folder. See [Example Configuration](#configuration)

Run AutoStore

```
npm run start --silent
```

## Command Arguments

`--config` to specify a different configuration file path other than default `./config.json`

```
npm run start -- --config ./other/config.json
```

` --dry-run`Â option to have autostore print document details without transferring any documents to file cabinet. This option can be used for testing filter patterns, or intellix trust levels.

```
npm run start -- --dry-run
```
